### Success Fees (Optional)

When appropriate and mutually agreed upon, we may structure performance-based compensation:

- Typically 5-15% of incremental value created
- Paid only upon successful exit or measurable value realization

**Transaction Completion Fees**
- Fixed dollar amounts (not percentage-based)
- Tied to specific milestones
- Only applicable when explicitly agreed in engagement letter

**Note**: Success fees are always supplemental to base retainers, never the primary compensation structure.

## Why Fee-Based vs. Commission-Based?

### Commission-Based Brokers (Typical 10-15% of Sale Price)

❌ **Conflicts of Interest**: Incentivized to push for quick sale  
❌ **Timing Pressure**: Motivation to sell now vs. when optimal  
❌ **Lower Valuations Acceptable**: Any sale generates commission  
❌ **Limited Value Enhancement**: No incentive to improve business first  
❌ **Percentage-Based Costs**: Fees scale with transaction size unnecessarily  

### Fee-Based Advisory (RTO Advisory Model)

✅ **Aligned Interests**: Paid for advice, not sale completion  
✅ **Optimal Timing**: Recommend selling only when truly right  
✅ **Value Maximization**: Focus on achieving best possible outcome  
✅ **Strategic Preparation**: Multi-year value enhancement programs  
✅ **Transparent Costs**: Fixed fees known upfront  
✅ **No Pressure**: Guidance based solely on your best interests

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why should I pay upfront fees instead of just a success fee?**

A: Upfront retainers ensure our advice is objective and in your best interests, not influenced by the desire to close a transaction. Success fees alone create pressure to sell quickly rather than optimize timing and value.

**Q: How do your fees compare to commission-based brokers?**

A: On a typical $20-50M transaction, commission-based brokers charge 8-12% ($1.6M - $6M). Our total fees are typically $100K-400K, a fraction of the cost while delivering superior value through strategic preparation.

**Q: What if I decide not to sell after the engagement?**

A: That's perfectly fine. Our goal is to provide objective advice. If the analysis shows selling isn't optimal, we'll tell you—and help you build value for a future exit when timing is right.

**Q: Can fees be paid over time?**

A: Yes, we structure retainers to be paid in installments aligned with project milestones or monthly for ongoing engagements.

**Q: Do you ever work on pure contingency?**

A: No. Pure contingency arrangements create inherent conflicts of interest. We may include optional success fees *in addition to* base retainers when appropriate.

**Q: What size companies do you work with?**

A: We focus on middle-market companies typically with $5M - $100M in revenue or $2M - $20M in EBITDA.
